🚀 Exciting Milestone: My First Responsive Website! 🎉

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve just completed my first responsive website using display: flex! 💻✨

This project is a huge step in my journey to becoming a front-end developer, and I couldn’t have done it without the incredible learning experience from Route Academy.

Creating a site that adapts beautifully to any screen size has been both challenging and rewarding. Can’t wait to dive deeper into more web development skills!

Check it out and let me know what you think! 🌐
